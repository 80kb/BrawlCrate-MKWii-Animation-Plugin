The **BrawlCrate MKWii Animation Plugin** is a plugin for [BrawlCrate](https://github.com/soopercool101/BrawlCrate) that allows users to more quickly import texture animations to their MKWii Custom Track's Brres file.

## Usage
Select an animation to add to your track from the plugin menu. When prompted, type the name of the material to replace with the selected animation.

To create your own preset, select "New Preset" in the plugin menu. When prompted, type in your desired preset name. Then, type the name of the material to save as your preset. 
User created presets require all of the materials corresponding textures, shaders, and animations.
